This following is a very simple team meeting template. You should expand it based on the scope and nature of your discussion.

## Team Meeting [01] - Week [7] - [0415] (18:15-19:50)
**Absent:None **
<br>
**Lead/scribe:Wanzhong Wu**

## Agreed Procedure
Stand up Procedure: 
-  Brainstorm about what kind of software we want to develop.
- Time and requirements for the next meeting.
- conflict resolution protocol:
1、Task Allocation: If a team member is unable to complete their assigned tasks due to health issues, time conflicts, technical difficulties, or other reasons, their contribution to the project will be accordingly adjusted, and the tasks will be reassigned to ensure timely completion.
2、Meeting Attendance: If any team member is unable to attend the weekly meetings due to special circumstances, we will provide them with the relevant materials and meeting minutes. This ensures they can stay informed and provide timely feedback.
3、Conceptual Disagreements: In cases of conflict arising from differences in project design or concepts, we will conduct a group vote. The plan that receives the highest number of votes will be implemented, ensuring a democratic resolution of disputes.
4、Communication: To prevent conflicts and misunderstandings, all team members must use group chat to communicate their progress and any difficulties encountered within the project. This proactive communication helps maintain clarity and cohesion among team members.

## Meeting Minutes

-  Brainstorming:
  The following two topics are based on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12:
1、Waste Sorting Game: Different types of garbage fall from the sky, and players need to select the correct trash bin to catch the garbage. If they successfully sort it, they earn points.
2、Second-hand Bicycle Trading App: Features include trading of second-hand bicycles, private messaging between buyers and sellers, and forum interactions (bicycle selection, maintenance, cycling tips, etc.).

Interactive Discussion: Since the second-hand bicycle app is more complex, the discussion will mainly focus on the waste sorting game. Questions to consider include: Is there a benchmark for this app? Who are the target users? How can we enhance the basic search feature? What extended features can be added (user rankings, points, etc.)?

-  Group Assignment Document Analysis: During the brainstorming session, the requirements for the group assignment, especially the basic and extended features, were analyzed in detail.

- Meeting Plan：Decide to have another meeting tomorrow with the following agenda:
1、Finalize the app themes to be developed: Each person should bring a well-developed theme, which includes five basic functions and at least five extended functions. Share these themes in the group beforehand to allow others to familiarize themselves. 
2、Division of Labor: Finalize the basic and extended functional modules, set deadlines for each function, and assign responsible persons.

- Regular Meeting: Decide to hold weekly meetings every Monday from 7 PM to 8 PM, with a rotation for taking meeting minutes.
