## Agreed Procedure

- Everyone introduces their own ideas about the APP theme and functions, including 5 basic features and 5 custom features.<br>
  Two APP themes about the second-hand market: ReFind Goods, Looplocal.<br>
  Two other mutual aid interaction platforms based on GPS real-time positioning: SafeGuard, Community Health Aide.
- Discussion of APP theme and functions: Discuss whether the APP theme is closely related to one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and discuss the difficulty of developing specific functions of the APP.
- It is determined that the group’s APP theme is to create a second-hand goods trading market based on GPS. It is in line with SDGs 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.<br>
  The app directly supports the goal of promoting sustainable consumption by promoting the reuse and recycling of items, reducing waste and optimizing resource management.
- The team members discuss how many data tables are needed and divided it into several basic tasks.<br>
  Task 1 : Generate data for 2500 products.<br>
  Task 2 : Data table structure design, including product name, category and shelf time(Use json or xml to store).<br>
  Task 3 : APP function and interface design,Including public methods for reading/writing json and xml, login(), load(), refresh() and search(). <br>
  Task 4 : Draw UML and extend custom features. <br>
  Task 5 : Write app functional testing methods. <br>
- Determine the order of tasks: Task2 comes first, followed by Task1. Task5 and Task3 are performed at the same time. Task 3 and Task 4 can also be performed at the same time.
- Determine the content of the next meeting: <br>
  1. Exchange and optimization of results of basic features. <br>
  2. Finalize what extended functions and division of labor are needed.
